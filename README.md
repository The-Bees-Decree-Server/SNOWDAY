# READ!!! THIS MOD NOW HAS A DEPENDANCY ON JOTUNN (JVL). SINCE THE CHANGE PLEASE BACK UP YOUR WORLD FIRST JUST TO BE SAFE!!!

  <h6> 
  
You've found a Magickal Mitten! Wonder what fun things you can do with it?
   


All pieces are found in a dedicated "hammer", *MagickMitten*.  

*item_MagickMitten* takes 10 Wolf Pelt, 5 Blueberries and 50 Crystals to craft.   

Most recipes in mitten require NO MATERIALS.  
But there is a caveat, you're bloody cold and it takes a fair bit of stamina to play with all this snow!
  
Peices are divided into two sections, Snow build peices in BUILDING tab and Ice build pieces in MISC build tab.
Snow pieces can ONLY be built in the Mountains and Ice in the Deep North.

 Don't like the recipes? Use a custom recipe editor, like [Wacky's Database](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/WackyMole/WackysDatabase/).
  
<p>

Install by unzipping package and dropping *SNOWDAY.dll* into your client side and/or server **plugins** folder.
*TheBeesDecree.SNOWDAY.cfg* will generate upon running game/restarting server.

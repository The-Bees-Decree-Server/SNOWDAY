# SNOWDAY v1.1.9

You've found a Magickal Mitten! Wonder what fun things you can do with it?
   


All pieces are found in a dedicated "hammer", *MagickMitten*.  

*item_MagickMitten* takes 10 Wolf Pelt, 5 Blueberries and 50 Crystals to craft. 
Recipe for hammer can be locked/adjusted via SERVER SYNC/config.  

Most recipes in mitten require NO MATERIALS.  
But there is a caveat, you're bloody cold and it takes a fair bit of stamina to play with all this snow!
  
Peices are divided into two sections, Snow build peices in BUILDING tab and Ice build pieces in MISC build tab.
Snow pieces can ONLY be built in the Mountains and Ice in the Deep North.

>**SNOWDAY** only requires **BEPINEX** as a dependency.

Install by unzipping package and dropping *SNOWDAY.dll* into your client side and/or server **plugins** folder.
